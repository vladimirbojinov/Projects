# GuessTheNumber
This is a game with two player, the first player chooses a random number and the second player is trying to guess the number.  
# About the project
The program is entirely writen in C# and it is a console based game.  
This project aim to recreate the game but with only 1 player, the second player is a computer.  
When the program run the computer chooses a number in the range of 1 - 100 and the player have to guess the right number.  
# How does the code work
First the computer is choosing a random number.  
Then a cycle is started which ends when the player chooses the right number.  
To know how close the player is there is a series of checks that are telling the player if he is "Too Low" or "Too Hight" to the correct number.  
If the player is curious about how many guesses he has made there is a counter that tells at the end.
